# Modify PDF

Add margin to PDFs in bulk.

Made for printing out lecture slides that include space for notes.

## Usage

Drag and drop PDF files and configure how much margin to add.

Use printer dialog "pages per sheet" feature to print multiple slides per sheet. I recommend 2 or 4 pages per sheet. Depends on how much content each slide has.
